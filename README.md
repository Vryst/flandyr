Welcome to **Flandyr** :D

(this is my first game project here! please don't judge me harshly :'v)

In this game, y'all will fight enemies(monsters obviously, there's many tribes too that could ended up having their blod on thy sword üíÄ), level up, and avoid the ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù screen that comes after you make a ridiculously bad decision(git gud). Think of it as a choose-your-own-whatever book, with a lot more stats, combat, and questionable choices. All it takes is your imagination (and maybe a bit of kaffe ‚òï).
So, grab your sword, dive into a world where anything is possible... welp, as long i have many ideas to put into this game

YOUR SUGGESTIONS IS HIGHLY NEEDED (‚Å†‚âß‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚â¶‚Å†)
